# Drive-mimic
Rest Django API

This has been an effort to mimic the Google Drive API backed up by firebase storage .

The user can login or logout from the API
but the registration can only be done by the admin .
I intend to add the registering user functionality later .

We can see the list of items at ../api/postings 
and each item can be accesed by ../api/postings/<id>
where it can be updated or deleted by the user 
but can be viewed in ReadOnly 
mode by everyone authenticated .

Hope you like it !
